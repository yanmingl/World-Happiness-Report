### Insights:

- Developing countries need to foster economy but developed countries should shift their attention to social and family support.
- With more freedom comes more trust.
- Health is closely related to wealth and family support.
- Generosity follows suit in countries with high freedom and trust scores.
- Using parameters like GDP, trust, happiness scores, choose your next country to travel to.

### Conclusion: 
The Happiness Scoreâ€™s sweet spot is that we can successfully measure a countries growth not just by its GDP but also by factors like Family Relationships, Trust, Freedom, Health and Generosity that better represent the overall progress of the country.
